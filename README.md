#DNSBL

##The idea?
The aim of this project is to create an open source DNS Blacklist Monitoring Application. As a developer I find that monitoring servers can be a pain and tools for monitoring DNSBL's seem to cost so much, that shouldn't have to be the case.

## What's been done?
The URL `http://dnsbl.co.uk` has been set up as the homepage of this application.

## Getting invloved
I'm currently looking for people to get involved with ideas/the build. All input is welcomed.

Fork the project or get in touch at daryll@dnsbl.co.uk with some ideas.

Lets get this started.
