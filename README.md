#DNSBL

##The idea?
The aim of this project is to create an open source and free to use DNS Blacklist Monitoring Service. As a developer I find that monitoring servers can be a pain and tools for monitoring DNSBL's seem to cost so much, that shouldn;'t have to be the case.

## What's been done?
The URL `http://dnsbl.co.uk` has been set up to host this service.

## Getting invloved
I'm currently looking for people to get involved with ideas/the build. All input is welcomed.

Lets get this started.
